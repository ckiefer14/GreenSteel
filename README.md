# HAGS
Repository for codes relating to HAGS (Hydrogen Ammonium and Green Steel)

HAGS provides models for the production of Ammonium and Green Steel using hydrogen from renewable energy (HOPP)

These models are based off papers and codes of Abhinav Bhaskar of the University of Stavanger in Norway
His repository can be found here:
https://github.com/abhinavbhaskar/HDRI-EAF-Technoeconomic-model/tree/V1.0


HAGS_Testing is raw code to pull many outputs

HAGS_Cleaned is a "cleaned" code that removes unnecessary calculations for the purpose to be inputted into HOPP #REMOVED
